# Social-Buzz
Social Buzz emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous,
only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. There are over 100 ways that users can
react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments.
This ensures that trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of user
feeds.

Social Buzz has reached over 500 million active users each month.

their scaling process effectively. They are expecting the following:
